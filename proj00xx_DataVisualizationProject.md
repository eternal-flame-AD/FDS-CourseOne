## Data visualization project

For this project, we are going to visualize and fit some real data on pay as a function of gender, education level, and age. Your mission is to determin if females and males recieve roughly equal pay, and if this holds for people of ages and education levels.

The data are in the wageGenderEduAge.csv file.

There are 4 variables "wage", "education", "age", and "gender". Your job is to explore the data visually and to identify and illustrate any obvious and important trends. The data are real and, suitably presented, should reveal an actual problem in our society.

Note that there is one (and only one) obvious y-axis or "dependent" variable: wage. There is also one categorical or grouping variable: gender.

The final product should be a brief report – perhaps 3 figures or so – that reaches a data-driven conclusion about the state of the world.

Make sure describe each figure fully so that a naive reader could understand exactly what is being plotting, and make sure each figure has informative axis labels, etc., and that is looks good.
